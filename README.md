# Command4py
Command4Py is a class based command line application library. You can build a command line application by simply create a class and the methods of the class as the commands. It's dependency is only the **argparse** and **inspect** library that's already available in Python. Look at the example to learn.

### HOW TO USE:
- You can download the repository and put the **command4py** folder to the root directory of your python project 
- You can just download the **bundle.py** file in **command4py** directory It's the bundle file for all the source code

### TO DO:
- Add the typing feature so type annotation will be translated into the argument type in argparse

### Notes:
- Usually I update the **bundle.py** first before update the rest of the module
